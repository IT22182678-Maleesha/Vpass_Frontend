Introduction to the VPass System

The EPass Visitor Management System is an advanced, fully integrated, contactless solution designed to modernize how organizations handle visitor access. It streamlines entry workflows, strengthens security protocols, and enhances administrative efficiency across organizations of any scale. By replacing traditional paper-based methods with a seamless digital process, EPass creates a secure, intuitive, and highly automated visitor management ecosystem.

Core Features: Smart Pass Creation & Visitor Organization

A key component of the EPass system is its intelligent digital pass creation feature. Administrators can generate personalized visitor passes, each containing all required access details. Every pass includes a unique, encrypted, and time-sensitive QR code that acts as a secure digital access key.

Each pass includes:

Visitor Information – Name, contact details, identification photo

Access Permissions – Areas the visitor is allowed to enter

Time Restrictions – Valid visit duration and entry window

Visit Purpose – Meeting, interview, delivery, and more

Emergency Contact Details

Host Assignment – Employee responsible for the visitor

QR Code Scanning & Touchscreen Kiosk Interface

Upon arrival, visitors scan their QR code at a dedicated scanning station. High-resolution scanners support QR codes displayed on smartphones, tablets, or printed passes. Once scanned, the system triggers an interactive kiosk interface designed with:

Multi-language support
